# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions
name: CI
# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [master, develop]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  test:
    name: Test and check build
